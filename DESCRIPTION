Description: Implements a partial linear semiparametric mixed-effects model (PLSMM) featuring a random intercept and applies a lasso penalty to both the fixed effects and the coefficients associated with the nonlinear function. 
    The model also accommodates interactions between the nonlinear function and a grouping variable, allowing for the capture of group-specific nonlinearities. Nonlinear functions are modeled using a set of bases functions. Estimation is conducted using a penalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and the package offers flexibility in choosing between various information criteria for model selection. 
    Post-selection inference is carried out using a debiasing method, while inference on the nonlinear functions employs a bootstrap approach.
